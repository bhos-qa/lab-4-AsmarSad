In the previous lab, I had the opportunity to dive deeper into software testing topics, particularly code coverage, branch coverage, and predicate coverage. Based on my research:
Code Coverage: This is a key metric that shows the percentage of lines of code executed by the test suite. It helps identify untested parts of the codebase.
Branch Coverage: This focuses on testing all possible branches resulting from conditional statements in the code (like if or switch), ensuring that each decision path is exercised.
Predicate Coverage: This technique evaluates the boolean expressions in conditional statements, ensuring that each condition is tested for both true and false outcomes. It is essential for comprehensive testing of complex decision logic.
Together, these coverage metrics help ensure the robustness and reliability of the code by highlighting untested areas and ensuring all execution paths are validated.
